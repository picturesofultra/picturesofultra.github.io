                <p><p>Lisa Tamati takes you on a Himalayan adventure.</p>
<p>The worlds' highest running race - known as La Ultra - The High is a 222km non stop running race over the two highest motorable mountain passes in the world.
Held in the Indian region of Ladakh (translated &quot;The land of high passes&quot;)  is a region in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that currently extends from the Kunlun mountain range  to the main Great Himalayas to the south, inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent.It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Jammu and Kashmir and its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet.</p>
<p>In the past Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes, but since the Chinese authorities closed the borders with Tibet and Central Asia in the 1960s, international trade has dwindled but the Indian military maintains a strong hold there.</p>
<p>Every year this incredibly tough ultra marathon is held. This is a documentary following Lisa Tamati racing it in its second year of running.
The first year only one man, Mark Cockbain, managed to finish and the other two competitors and some of the crew all ended up in hospital with altitude related problems
This race sees the competitors go  up twice within a very short time space to altitudes over 5,700m, climbing over the infamous Kardung La and Tanglang La passes.</p>
<p>Oxygen levels up there are around 30% of what they are at sea level making it extremely tough to get enough oxygen to run.
The terrain is mountainous, the rugged single lane roads frequented by military convoys spewing unfiltered diesel into the mountain air add to the difficulties.</p>
<p>The competitors have extremes of temperature to deal with from 40 degrees celsius in the valleys to -3 in the mountains. This makes for slow going and there is more walking and running but don't underestimate how tough this is.</p>
<p>Before Lisa even started she had a brain concussion to deal with a ripped ligaments on her left ankle ten weeks prior to going. Meaning she is undertrained and not well and during the race Lisa faces asthma attacks, heat exhaustion, severe altitude related problems, snow storms and treacherous roads to try and be the first woman to conquer this race.</p>
<p>She ends up second behind the incredible Sharon Gayter from England but this 53hr and 5 minute odyssey will give the viewer a birdseye view on what its like to attempt something this mammoth, to face extreme fatigue, sleep deprivation and fear, altitude and health problems and to overcome and persevere against all odds.</p>
<p>Suffer and celebrate with Lisa on this once in a life time journey</p>
