On June 25, 2016 a collection of trail and ultra runners toed the line at the historic Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run running from Squaw Valley to Auburn. Among the 350+ were 4 women vying for the win and a coveted top 10 finish which is recognized annually at this prestigious event:

- Magdalena Boulet, a HOKA ONE ONE and GU ENERGY LABS athlete is the returning champion and a mother of one who lives and trains in the East Bay of Northern California. She has an incredible road background including earning a trip to the Olympics in 2008 by placing 2nd at the Olympic Trials.
- Devon Yanko is also a HOKA ONE ONE athlete and has excelled in many different ultra distances. This is her 2nd attempt at the Western States 100 Mile Race with her 1st resulting in a DNF, or Did Not Finish. She is the co-owner of MH Bread & Butter in San Anselmo, CA along with her husband Nathan.
- Kaci Lickteig placed 2nd in the 2015 running of the Western States 100 is among the favorites to win it. She hails from Omaha, Nebraska where she works as an in-patient physical therapist.
- Anna Mae Flynn of Lake Tahoe, CA is going for her 1st 100 mile attempt after gaining entry via a golden ticket slot at the Lake Sonoma 50 Mile Race in 2016. She is a teacher and a recent ultra athlete.
