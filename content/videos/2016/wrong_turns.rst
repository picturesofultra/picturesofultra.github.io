"Lighting The Fire: Wrong Turns" tells the story of Jim Walmsley's eventful start in the sport of ultrarunning. After being honorably discharged from the Air Force and dealing with bouts of severe depression, Walmsley turned to running to get his life back on track. He moved to Flagstaff, Arizona, and connected with a community of runners who helped him rebound and supported him after his infamous wrong turn at mile 93 of the 2016 Western States 100 race.
