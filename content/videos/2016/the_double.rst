From the heat, speed and competition at the Western States 100 to the high altitude, steep climbs and torrential weather of the Hardrock Hundred 100. For most, even attempting these two high profile 100-mile races is a lifetime achievement.  Watch as ultrarunner and family man Jeff Browning attempts to break the combined time record of 43h 33m in these two races. . . with only 19 days of rest in between.
