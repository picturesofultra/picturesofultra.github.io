On October 4, 2016 Jim Walmsley broke the Grand Canyon Rim 2 Rim 2 Rim record of running from the South to North Rim of Grand Canyon and back. Jim runs a 5:55:20 which is the first ever sub 6 hour time for this route. Here we follow him for the 2.5 mile descent on the North Kaibab trail half way through his historic run.
