Beau Miles laces up for a different kind of world first, running 650+km of the Australian Alpine Walking Track. Traversing through some of the highest peaks in Australia, Beau battles injury, fatigue and ultimately himself in his own personal Trial of Miles. For trail blazers of this new era, running long distance walking trails, passing through wild landscapes quickly seems to nourish a new kind of physical craving. Not, as is the case for Trials of Miles, without questioning how and why we drag ourselves, and our family, into the endevour.  This film unpacks the physical and mindful nature of being the first to run the Australian Alps walking track.
