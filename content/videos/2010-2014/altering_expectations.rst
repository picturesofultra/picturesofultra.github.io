On October 18th, 2014, Kimberley Teshima attempted to run her very first ultramarathon - The Oregon Coast 50k. Despite putting in long hours on the trails while balancing a full-time job, Kim ran into a number of unforeseen issues. From endless dry-heaving and anxiety to full body cramping and racing to meet time cut-offs, this course put her to the test. I went along for the ride and tried to capture as much of it on film as possible.
