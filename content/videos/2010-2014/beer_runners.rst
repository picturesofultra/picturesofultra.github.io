After enduring a personal struggle, David April began to search for positive ways to heal himself. Running became his medicine, and that outlet grew into a community where people support and encourage the success of others. Inspired by a Spanish professor's groundbreaking scientific study proving that drinking a beer after a run can hydrate the body better than water, David founded the 'Fishtown Beer Runners.' The Philadelphia based club runs five to ten kilometers every week, ending up at a different bar, where they have a couple of beers and toast to 'The Professor.' David's journey has not only helped others turn their lives around, it has influenced an international beer running movement in Spain, promoting responsible consumption and exercise.

Not really a film about running ultras, but who cares, its awesome and it features loads of beer drinking.

“Beer Runners” is the best film I’ver ever seen about running, and I’ve seen them all. I had no idea that the coolest running club in America was created from heartache and grew into an emotional, inspiring, hilariously-fun gang of misfits that has saved literally lives and inspired scientific research. Bring a hanky and a beer, because you’ll want to wipe tears and raise a toast “To the Professor!"
