Déjame Vivir is a story of determination, spectacular landscapes and unshakeable friend- ship. Following in the footsteps of the pioneers of Sky Running, Kilian Jornet and a small group of like-minded friends push the boundaries of possibility to new limits in a series of mountain adventures.

From a tale of friendship on the glaciers of Mont Blanc to the hostile conditions and
raw energy of Mount Elbrus, experience the mountains from a unique and breathtaking perspective and accompany Kilian as he re-writes the rulebook of mountain running. Culminating in an attempt to break a record on the iconic Matterhorn, can all the factors align to help him make his childhood dreams come true?

Uncovering the motivations behind his pursuit to push himself beyond all boundaries, we share intimate moments behind the scenes and discover what drives this exceptional athlete.
