Why do we decide to explore mountains, trails and the wilderness? Perhaps because "we can never have enough of nature" as Henry David Thoreau once described. The Ingenuous Choice features mountain runner Anton Krupicka exploring the wilderness of the mountains, racing 100 miles and reflecting on what makes mountain running essential to him.
