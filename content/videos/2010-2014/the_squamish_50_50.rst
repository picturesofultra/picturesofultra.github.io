"In August 2013, I ran the Squamish 50 mile ultramarathon. It was the hardest race I had run and it destroyed my body and mind. Rather than back down and give in to the race, I pushed on and struggled to the finishline. After making a vow to never go back, I returned in 2014 to not only run the 50 mile race again, but tack on the 50k race the following day in what has been coined, The Squamish 50/50."
