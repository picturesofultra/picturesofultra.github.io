Sarah Ridgway is a Welsh international runner specialising in mountainous terrain. Her love of gnarly conditions helped her secure the woman’s record for the classic Snowdon Horseshoe in a time of 1hr 43min.
'The key is to just do what you are passionate about and do it for the simple joy it brings you – if other rewards come out of it then accept them graciously but don’t let them be your driver – just let your true passions guide you and the rest will come. Infact after the horseshoe I felt so inspired and reinvigorated I raced quite a bit and had some of my best ever performances!' - Sarah Ridgway

Sarah works as a guide in her business Run Snowdonia (runsnowdonia.co.uk), one of the premier guided running services in the UK. The business involves anything from taking people for scenic guided runs, a hard training session or instructing people on how to run safely in the mountains.
