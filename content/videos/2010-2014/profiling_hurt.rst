Profiling HURT follows the path of ultra runner Mark Gilligan and his work to return to the race for a second year, to achieve what he couldn't in his first. Joined by protagonist Scott Guild, the two take you to the course and drop you in the middle of it all so you can see what it's all about. Mud, injuries, training runs, and drop outs. It's not just a race for the finish, it's a battle to know how far you can go.
