In June 2008, a 26 yr old runner ventured deep into the Gobi Desert to compete in one of the toughest endurance events on the Planet - a 7-day, 250km, self-supporting foot race through some of the harshest terrain on earth. It was the first Ultra-Marathon Ryan Sandes had ever run. He won every stage... Shattering perceptions on what was possible in the running world. Overnight and single-handed, Ryan had put trail running on the map in South Africa. Four months later Ryan won every stage of the Sahara Desert race and established himself as one of the best endurance athletes in the world. 'Wandering Fever' is the personal story of a young South African, Ryan Sandes, and his journey in becoming the first person in history to win all 4Deserts (which Time Magazine has rated no.2 in the Top 10 Toughest Endurance Events in the world), and arguably the best multi-stage Ultra-Marathon runner on earth.
