Langtang is the story of a journey to the heart for Nepal. After having to cancel their Everest expedition following the catastrophic earthquake that hit the country, Kilian Jornet and his team decide to continue with their trip with a change of objective. They will witness first hand how the force of nature can turn executioner for a valley and its inhabitants. Langtang is also an ode to life, a tribute to hope and a search for new horizons
