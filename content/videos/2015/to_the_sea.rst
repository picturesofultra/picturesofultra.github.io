In the late 70s, surfing was professionalised by a group of young surfers, allowing them the chance to make a career out of doing what they loved most. Today the sport of Trail Running finds itself following a similar path.

'To the Sea' explores the similarities between these two sports through the perspectives of Salomon Runner Ryan Sandes, Pro Big-Wave Surfer Frank Solomon and the first ever surfing World Champion and pioneer of professional surfing, Shaun Tomson.
