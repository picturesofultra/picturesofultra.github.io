At noon on September 18, 2015 a group of elite athletes (Hares) toed the starting line to begin a 100 mile race through and over the mountains surrounding Steamboat Springs, CO. 

With a mere 61% finishing rate, the 2015 Run Rabbit Run 100 mile race turned out to be quite interesting in the hunt for a podium spot.
