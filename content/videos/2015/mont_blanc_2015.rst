On August 28, 2015 a small team of Nike athletes went overseas to Chamonix, France to compete in some of the biggest ultra endurance events in the world.

The UTMB® (Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc) is a 170 km/105 mile race circumventing the Alps, crossing into 3 countries with over 33,000 ft of elevation gain.

The CCC® (Chamonix-Courmayeur-Champex) is a 101 km race starting in Courmayeur, Italy and also finishing in Chamonix, France. This race has over 20,000 ft of positive elevation change.

Both events are considering one of the toughest at its respective distances. American men have not typically fared well there. As such, Nike athletes David Laney (UTMB), Tim Tollefson (CCC) and Zach Miller (CCC) set out to prove that American men can compete and compete well in the imposing European mountains.
