Can you go from a non runner to a runner and then complete a Bob Graham Round in just a year?
The Bob Graham Round is a classic fell running challenge set in the English Lake District. Only 2000 runners have managed to complete the round since its creation in 1932. It consists of 104km distance, 8,000 metres of ascent and running a loop of 42 peaks in less than 24 hours. Only a third  of people who start the Bob Graham Round finish in under the 24hrs.
This film follows Ian Palmer as he attempts the Bob Graham Round only 12 months after he started running.
