BD Athlete Joe Grant was looking for an experience. He wanted it to be hard, and he wanted to push himself to “that edge” where he’d have to make difficult decisions. That’s why he chose Nolan’s 14—a rowdy jaunt through Colorado’s Sawatch range, which links 14 14,000-foot mountains over 100 miles. Needless to say, Joe found what he was looking for, and in the process, set the unsupported record for the route. This is his story.
