The Middle Way is an intimate look into Joe Grant's Tour de 14er project. Joe set out from his doorstep in Gold Hill, Colorado to attempt to summit all 54 of Colorado's 14000ft mountains in a single push. By bike and on foot, self-powered, self supported. Alone. 1100 miles of riding, 600 miles of running and roughly 100 000 ft of climbing.

“The camera ended up becoming this interesting way to externalize what I was thinking. At first, I was more self-conscious about saying the right thing. As the trip sort of went on, I didn’t really care anymore. With so much time alone, the camera became something like a friend" [Joe Grant]
