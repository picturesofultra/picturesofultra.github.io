In December 2018, Damian Hall and Beth Pascall attempted to break the Cape Wrath Trail self supported 'fastest known time' (FKT) of 7 days, 9 hours and 31 minutes. 
 
The Cape Wrath Trail is notoriously wild, remote and inhospitable, the terrain it winds through is regarded as the last true wilderness in Britain. 
 
Their attempt takes place in the depths of winter when there is only 6 hours of daylight each day
