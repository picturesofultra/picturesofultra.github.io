The Manitou Incline, or simply “The Incline”, is one of Colorado’s most famous hiking trails. Gaining over 2000ft of elevation in less than a mile, the trail is the remains of a decommissioned funicular railway. Famous for its sweeping views and steep grade the Incline has in recent years become a focal point for an eccentric, off-kilter community. “Inclined”, dives into this community and explores how a one-mile section of trail has managed to bring people together from all walks of life.
