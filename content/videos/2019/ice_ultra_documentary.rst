In February 2018, a group of runners took on the Ice Ultra, a yearly, 230km, 5-day race inside the Arctic circle.

For the first time in the race's history, Beyond the Ultimate let a film crew behind the scenes.  The resulting film focuses on the beauty and isolation the runners experience during their journey across Arctic Sweden, rather than the obvious hardship of racing in this uniquely challenging environment.

The Ice Ultra takes place in Swedish Lapland.  It’s Europe’s last remaining wilderness and the heartland of the indigenous Sámi people.  This area, Jokkmokk municipality, an area the size of Wales but with a population of only around three thousand, can experience daytime temperatures as low as -40°c and the days are short.

Ice Ultra follows the runners and race team as the adventure makes its way across a freezing, windswept landscape.   The days are short and the course is long; runners spend long hours running in darkness, following the marked route by head torch, under skies free of light pollution and filled with stars and sightings of Aurora.

White-capped mountains dominate the horizon.  All around is silent and peaceful, broken only by the crunch of footsteps in the snow as runners make their way through this UNESCO world heritage area.
