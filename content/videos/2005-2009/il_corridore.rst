Marco Olmo is a living legend of extreme running. He became late, when the others started to stop.

In his previous lives, as he says, he has been a farmer, a truck driver, a workman.

Running has became his reason for living, the way to take revenge on his hard destiny.

At the age of 58 he has became Ultratrail World Champion, winning the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc, the hardest and most important endurance race in the world, over twenty hours of uninterrupted running, 167 km (over 100 miles) around the tallest mountain in Europe.

An almost unimaginable speciality, where mental and physical training and personal motivations are fundamental.

Despite age, physical problems and always younger and more prepared opponents, he doesnt want to stop. For one year he prepares for the new edition of the Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc. This competirtion, which for two consecutive times has consecreted him as the champion, could become the last of his career. Marco must win, to show himself that he can still do it.

This is his story.
