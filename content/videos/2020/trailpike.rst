A linked series of 3 short films recognising the 3 running legends who have given their names to iconic running challenges in the Lake District.

Poet and Fell Runner Geoff Cox has teamed up with film-makers from “No Routes Found Collective” to create three distinctly different short films aimed at the burgeoning outdoor film-festival audience.Geoff is a Lake District resident who has been part of the fell running scene for many years. He decided to mark his 60th birthday year by running all three of these long-distance Lakeland test pieces, record-ing the experiences through his highly evocative poetry.
