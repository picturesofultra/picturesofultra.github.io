One of the toughest races "The Montane Spine" took place in midwinter England. It is a non-stop 420km (268 miles) race and the competitors must struggle with sleep deprivation. They also battle with the unpredictable winter weather of England. The heavy cold rain made runners soaked. Snowstorm on the snowy plain made them freeze. The temperature could be felt like minus 20 degrees Celsius. Above all, the strong wind with 20mps. some could not even stand and forced to crawl on the ground. Many of the competitors suffer from mental and physical exhaustion. "Let's stop here!" "You did your best!" - "Satan's Whisper" made them drop out the race and the upheaval occurred. In such a severe situation, 51-year-old veteran runner fights hard to win. He controls the race with experience and precise strategy, not physical fitness. Also, 38-year-old woman kept running with a smile on her face. What was the secret of her strength?
