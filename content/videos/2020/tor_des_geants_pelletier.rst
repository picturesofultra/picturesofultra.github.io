The 330 km TOR Des Geants is a race in the Italian Alps. The course heads counter-clockwise on the Alta Via 2 along the south side of the Aosta valley for the first half of the race, returning along the Alta Via 1 back to Courmayeur.

The 2018 TOR was my first 200 miler. What follows is just a brief look at my experience at the race, all the ups and the downs on my journey among the giants of the alps.
