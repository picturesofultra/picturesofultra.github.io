Birdy’s Backyard Ultra, Lake Towerrinning, Western Australia. A 6.71k run around a lake, on the hour, every hour until the last one standing. We follow 5 runners at the 2020 event as they share what it takes to attempt this format of ultra marathon running that is more a battle of mental determination, grit and strength than physical ability.
