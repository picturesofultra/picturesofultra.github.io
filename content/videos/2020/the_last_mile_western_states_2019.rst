After finishing 4th female at Western States in 2017 and 2nd female behind Courtney Dauwalter at Western States in 2018, ultrarunner & adventurer, Kaytlyn Gerbin, returned in 2019 in hopes of improving her finish. After an increasingly grueling day in the notorious California high country and 99 miles of all-out mountain running, her race came down to The Last Mile.
