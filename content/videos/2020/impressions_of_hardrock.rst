There are so many stories at the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run, but the grandeur of the mountains is an incredible tale in and of itself. Enjoy the beauty of the San Juan mountains and the minuscule runners that traverse them. We spent three years filming at Hardrock and the beauty of the course became our story. Enjoy the scenic time-lapses of Hardrock as a backdrop in your own home.
