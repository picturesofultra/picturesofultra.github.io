The Tarahumara tribe was made popular in Born to Run, a best-selling novel by Chris McDougall. GOSHEN is a powerful documentary depicting the diet and active lifestyle of the indigenous Tarahumara, a light-footed running tribe, who are striving to maintain their ancient culture against all odds.

The Tarahumara are renowned for their incredible long-distance running endurance and prevention of modern chronic diseases. For centuries, the Tarahumara have found a safe place of refuge in the remote depths of Mexico’s Copper Canyons. 

Recently, drought and famine have threatened the Tarahumara’s ability to sustain their ancient cultural traditions. GOSHEN takes you on a journey in the huarache-clad footsteps of these endurance athletes, highlighting the health benefits of safeguarding their way of life. Engaging and entertaining, GOSHEN will inspire you to take part in preserving the native seeds and running traditions of the Tarahumara.
