Three normal guys, brought together by a love for running, who take on the holy grail of trail running, Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc.

'The Hundred Miler' chronicles the incredible running journey of Pat, Jacko and Steve which takes them from Australia to France, Switzerland and Italy. A story which involves years of training and preparation, traverses 170 gruelling kilometres of technical terrain, and requires some "hard, hard yakka". What does it take to face the hundred miler?

Directed and produced by George Webster and co-produced by Bryony Simcox, this film has been more than three years in the making. The film started as an idea in Sydney, and saw us attend some incredible races in the Australian bush, before heading to France with the runners and support crew for UTMB 2019. The film has since been edited in the UK and completed in Spain, and has been an absolute pleasure to produce. It is with great honour that we are now able to release it, and we are utterly grateful for the support we've had along the way. Thank you!
