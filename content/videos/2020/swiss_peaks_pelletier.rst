The SwissPeaks 360k is a trail running race that travels more than 360 km (224 miles) across the Swiss Alps, climbing over 26,000 metres (87,000 feet). Runners have up to 160 hours to complete the race, refuelling at the 31 minor aid stations, with the option to sleep at any of the 6 major life bases along the way.

My goal would be to finish in between roughly 100-120 hours, and to sleep around 6-7 hours over the 4 to 5 day period. This was my second race over 200 miles, and I swore to myself that I would never try to do it again.
