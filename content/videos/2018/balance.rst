Body language is a real expression
philosophy of life and a way to reconnect with its deep nature. Mathieu confronts his fears, but especially the letting go, the acceptance of physiological and climatic constraints to finally connect and adapt to this other universe that is the bottom of the sea or the top of the mountains. Control of breathing, stress management, introspection, he explores here his physical and mental sensations in the great wilderness.

A recently bruised little brother who inspires him, the importance of family and community support, the need to return to sources, this story finally tells the balance of an emotional quest for intensification of existence.

In equilibrium, terrestrial nature and ocean agree by natural links such as the cycle of water. These environments exert a powerful and vital spiritual force for living beings. Connection and interaction by scuba diving and running in nature are a philosophy of life. A way to reconnect with our deep nature.
