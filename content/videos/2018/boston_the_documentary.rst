From its humble origins 120 years ago to present day, Boston immerses the viewer into the wondrous kaleidoscope of the oldest annually contested marathon in the world.

Evolving from a workingman s challenge to welcoming foreign athletes and eventually women, the iconic race paved the way for the modern marathon and mass participatory sports.

Narrated by Academy Award winner Matt Damon, Boston features many of running s greatest champions including Shalane Flanagan, Meb Keflezighi, Bill Rodgers, Frank Shorter and Joan Benoit Samuelson.
