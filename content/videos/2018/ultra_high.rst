ULTRA HIGH is about the race to complete the 137-mile high altitude ultra marathon, crossing the two highest motorable passes of the Hymalayas. Battled out by six ultra runners from around the globe, the race starts 50-miles outside of the city of Leh in the Himalayas of Northern India. Traveling across the mountain passes of Khardung La and Tanglang La, each runner must find their way along the twisted climbs peaking at up to 18,300 feet in order to arrive at the finish line in under 60-hours.

Waiting at the start like fine-tuned race cars the runners are set to go, but the course is long and danger is inevitable. Leading the way, Ray Sanchez is a strong candidate to break the course record, but trailing close behind is Sharon Gayner out of the U.K. and she has first place hopes in her eyes. Facing up against high altitude pulmonary edema, hypothermia, exhaustion, and all the elements that come from running at over 18,000 feet, each runner finds themselves lacking the air to breathe and the energy to go on. With all the action of the ‘tour de France’ on foot, and the inspiration to fight for more within yourself. ULTRA HIGH is a high altitude battle to the finish at 18,000 feet.
