When Kevin Davis first began running, he was overweight and out of shape. Now, years later, he runs 100-mile races. He uses that fitness to support his other passion of backcountry hunting. The film "A Few Steps Further" explores the crossover between endurance sports and hunting, as well as the need for public lands and wild places to do both.
