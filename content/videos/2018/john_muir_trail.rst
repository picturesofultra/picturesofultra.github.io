Ultratrail has always been Francois' main excuse or reason to drop everything and leave on a new adventure. For this to happen, he tries to broaden his horizons with a new trail or destination every time. After completing the GR20, little were the options to top it off. Then came the idea of the John Muir Trail or JMT.

The JMT presents many challenges: its distamce, the isolation and the altitude, to name only a few,make it one of the most beautiful trail in the world.

Attempting to run 350km of single trail crossing the isolated and mystic mountains of the Sierra Nevada is no small feat. Do it in a single shot and that's what legends are made of.
