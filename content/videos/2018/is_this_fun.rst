Filmed over the course of the 9 Dragon’s weekend, “Is this fun?” dives into the psyche of two runners, John Ellis & Jo Kway, to understand each runners’ personal reason for taking on a challenge that covers 168km, runs through a night and has a finish rate of 35%.

With the 9 Dragon’s route as the film’s canvas, “Is this fun?” showcases the best of HK’s trail running scenery with brutal climbs and stunning ridge routes. Everyone’s goals are different and through “Is this fun?,” we explore John and Jo’s contrasting views of why they take part in these challenges along with the elation of success.
