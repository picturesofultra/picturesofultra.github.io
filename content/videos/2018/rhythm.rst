We may call BD Athlete Joe Grant a “runner guy,” but honestly, those words fail to give a true notion of what he actually does. Truth is, Joe Grant heads into the mountains for a lot more than running. And what he finds out there, high among the craggy peaks, is what he likes to call rhythm. In this film, we captured Joe in his element, doing his thing and searching for that rhythm, deep in the heart of the Alps. Enjoy.
