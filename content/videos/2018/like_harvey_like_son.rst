On May 30th 2018, Ultra-runner and Cincinnati-based high school teacher Harvey Lewis III set out to attempt the Fastest Known Time on the Appalachian Trail. There are two ways to approach this feat- supported or unsupported. The moment Harvey’s father (Jr.) offered to be his son’s crew chief, he KNEW this challenge would be mean more to him than just putting in the miles. 

Separated from his father by divorce early in Harvey’s youth, the trail might certainly have lived up to its numerous metaphors, including the most used, “finding one’s self”, but together, he and his 78-year-old father-turned-crew-chief navigate the challenges of remote wilderness and unpredictable weather on their 2,190 mile journey to the top of Mount Katahdin. 

Along the way they encounter a cast of colorful characters, numerous geographic obstacles, excruciating physical pain, all the while discovering that the trail is about much more than just escape.  This time, they might truly find their way back together.
