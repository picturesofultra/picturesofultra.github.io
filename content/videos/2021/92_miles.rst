Two years into studying Wyoming's wild mule deer, researcher Patrick Rodger’s life was thrown into turmoil. Through the sudden loss of his best friend and father to cancer, Patrick was stripped of the person who taught him how to appreciate our public lands. The healing process has been a long migration: a journey facilitated by finding solace in the wild with a pair of ultra running shoes. Long distance running helps Pat to heal. The transformative 90+ mile backcountry run is a gripping adventure following one of Wyoming’s longest migration corridors for mule deer.
