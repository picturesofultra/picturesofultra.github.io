In August 2020, The North Face teammates, Dylan Bowman & Kaytlyn Gerbin, set out to push the limits of what is possible around the 94 mile Wonderland Trail in Mount Rainier National Park. Follow along on their historic Fastest Known Time efforts and get inspired by their commitment to each other's goals. I was incredibly honored to have the opportunity to tell their stories!

This is the Director's Cut of the movie which was created in collaboration with The North Face.
