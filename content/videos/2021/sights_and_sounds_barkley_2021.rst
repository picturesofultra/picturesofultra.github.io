Enjoy the sights, sounds and stories from this year's race, which returned to Frozen Head State Park after the event was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19. A sincere and special thank you to Jamil Coury for making this opportunity possible, and to Lazarus Lake for allowing me to share the Barkley Marathons experience.
