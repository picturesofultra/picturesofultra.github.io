After quitting her job to pursue her dream of running professionally, Brittany Charboneau quickly found herself not having any fun with the sport she loved. A tough debut at the New York City Marathon and the following training left Brittany broken physically, mentally, and emotionally. Was there really only one path to success in becoming a professional runner or could Brittany throw away everything and do things her own way? This is a documentary film about the path Brittany Charboneau has pursued and what she has discovered about running and herself in the process.
