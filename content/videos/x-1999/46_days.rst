Short film about Frank Giannino US transcon in 79, using archive footage.

Frank Giannino wasn’t the best runner in high school, not even close. He was too anxious, too uncertain, choking in nearly every big track meet. He sought attention as a chatterbox and showman, waving snakes at his oldest sister’s friends while victimized by self-doubt that started in childhood and formed thick layers through adolescence and into adulthood. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. Frank only knew with certainty that he could run. He could run miles and miles without tiring or suffering. In town for the 1978 Boston Marathon, a book jumped off the shelf at him. My Run Across the United States chronicled Don Shepherd’s story of running from Los Angeles to New York in 1964. Suddenly, Frank had a goal. But running across America wasn’t enough for him. He needed to squash his battle with insecurity. He needed to break the world record for fastest transcontinental crossing on foot. When Frank failed to break the record on his first try, he set out for his second crossing sixteen months later. It was an ordeal that would last 46 Days and remain a dominant factor for three ensuing decades that were laced with pain while he chased a greater goal: Happiness.
