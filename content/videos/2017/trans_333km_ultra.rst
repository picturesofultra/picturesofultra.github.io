Deep in the Sahara in one of the poorest and most dangerous countries on earth, an ultra marathon takes place.
A 333km non stop running event across the barren desert. 
LIsa Tamati,  an ultra marathon runner from New Zealand  and Gerhard Lusskandl of Austria are featured in this documentary as they  competed in this event. 
Lisa suffered debilitating food poisoning only hours into the start of the event and struggled hour by hour to keep going while Gerhard led the field in this gruelling event. 
This raw depiction of an extreme endurance event will have you enthralled.
