Stringbean tells the story of ultrarunner Joe McConaughy as he attempts to break the speed record on the Appalachian Trail. It takes most hikers 5-6 months to complete the 2,190-mile-long trail, but in the summer of 2017, Joe set out to hike it in 45 days. This short documentary offers a raw look at life on the trail from Joeâ€™s perspective, as he tries to hike 50 miles a day for 45 consecutive days on America's most iconic long trail.
