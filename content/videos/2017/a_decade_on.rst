In 2006, a young Seattle ultrarunner, Brian Morrison, attempted his first Western States 100. After running for 18 hours on the second hottest day in the race's history, he found himself in first place as he entered the historic finishing track,. Unfortunately, after using all of his strength to get there, his body gave out within feet of the finish. His crew helped him to his feet which ultimately lead him to not finish under his own power, resulting in a DNF or "Did Not Finish". 10 years later, Brian returned to finally get his coveted Western States 100 buckle.
