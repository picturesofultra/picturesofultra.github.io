In September of 2016 Krista Olson (daughter) and Bob Loomis (father) decided to run the Pine To Palm 100 mile race together. They had never previously run this kind of distance. This is the story of their race.

The Pine To Palm ultra marathon is no joke. It's a remote and rugged classic point to point course traversing the Siskiyou Mountain Range in Southern Oregon. Starting in Williams, OR the course winds it way east to Ashland, OR on a mixture of single track trail, dirt road, with less than 4 miles of pavement. The course boasts over 20,000 feet of climb, 20,000 feet of loss, three epic climbs to 7,000 feet, and fantastic views of Mt Shasta and Mt McLaughlin. 

With the stellar support of accomplished ultra runner Timothy Allen Olson (Krista's husband), as well as other family members, Bob and Krista successfully complete the entire race and tell an incredible story of perseverance. Grab your snacks, get comfortable, and watch their adventure unfold.
