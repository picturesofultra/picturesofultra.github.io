Tony Holt attempts the iconic Bob Graham Round: a 66 mile ultra distance mountain challenge taking in 42 of England's Lake District fells with 27,000ft of ascent, which must be completed within 24 hours. More than just a physical and mental challenge for the ultra-fit, Tony narrates his story and explains that it's running in the hills with friends that makes it so special.
