Badwater®135 has been called “The Toughest Footrace on Earth,” and covers 217 km (135 miles) non-stop from the basin of Death Valley, CA. Far away from the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean is the Marathon des Sables, which also has been called, “The Toughest Footrace on Earth”.

The two “toughest races on the earth” have one thing in common: the heat of the desert. Both races are in extreme climates with temperatures that regularly exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. So, what makes a tough race tough? The athlete and his preparation.

In this short documentary, you will meet Harvey Lewis and Mohamad Ahansal. 

Harvey won the 2014 Badwater® 135 and achieved second place in 2016. Mohamad Ahansal has five victories at the Marathon des Sables under his belt and has come in second place nine times.
Both runners were under pressure to endure in a new, unknown environment and to be able to recover quickly.

Exercise your transcendental state of mind!
