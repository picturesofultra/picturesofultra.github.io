The Hard Way is the inspirational story of Bob Hayes, an 89-year-old who runs 30 races each year, cuts his firewood by hand and does things the hard way to remain active and alive. The film follows Bob as he trains for the Bighorn 50k ultramarathon. As Bob pushes 90, the longer races take a larger toll. How will Bobâ€™s cadence of hard work and intention help him navigate the challenges of aging? The film takes us on a journey that is about more than running, it teaches us to live life with purpose and momentum.
