While most films today are available on streaming platforms
and accessible for free or a small fee, good ones,
older ones, unusual ones are
still hard to find, especially if they were made more than 3 or 4 years ago.

Video platform recommendation algorithms tend to put recent, sponsored
and "inspiring" films - i.e. mainstream - forward, while older, independently financed or original ones
tend to vanish from the web once their initial release campaign is over (if there ever was one).

Running images keeps those films accessible for the viewing pleasure running and/or film fanatics everywhere.

Do you think something is missing in Running Images ?
**Thanks for telling me about it** through the `Running Images FB Group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/424096735618087>`_

Firstly, some informations on what kind of films Running Images indexes.

What doesn't belong here :

- Fiction films. For the moment no fictions are added to Running images, though some great ones exist,
  most of them are feature length movies easilly found on listcle articles titled like "the 10 best running movies",
  "the 123 movies about running you should see before you die", etc ...

- Basic race reports and youtubber-made hand-held I-made-a-video-for-a-pair-of-shoes films
  don't belong here neither.

- Films on track races, or distances less than a marathon.

What does belong :

- Films that strive for originality, either in subject or form

- Old race reports, or TV short features, films that because of when they were made
  tell us something about days past

- Anything that seems to still be worth watching a few years/decades for now
